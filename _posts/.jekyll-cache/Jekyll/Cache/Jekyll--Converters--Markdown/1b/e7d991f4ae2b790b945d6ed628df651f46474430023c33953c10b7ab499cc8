<p>A much heralded, recent new product announcement got (and is getting) a lot of press and speculation.  I am 
talking about the launch of the new Amazon Kindle line. But what is so exciting? After all, the Kindle is 
just a book reader and is no competition for other devices from Samsung, Cisco and many others, including 
the one I am writing this entry on, the IPAD.  Right?</p>

<p>There is one big difference here.  Amazon has something to complement this seemingly simple product: 
They have a cloud (<em>and a pretty good one at that</em>).  How are these two items related?  Just like 
desktop virtualization moves the processing of applications (and games, animations and other applications 
that have heavy resource requirements) to the data center and uses the end user device primarily as a 
display device, the Amazon Cloud could perform these calculations, charging the Kindle owner only for the 
resources they need, and then use the Kindle for the display device.</p>

<p>So what makes this important for all of us working and supporting the public sector? According to the latest 
Gartner Top 10 List for 2012, the top two IT initiatives for the public sector are <strong>Media Tablets and Beyond</strong>
 and <strong>Mobile-Centric Applications and Interfaces</strong>.  They are going to be the two most important technology 
initiatives for us in 2012 and the years that follow.</p>

<p>That intersection of  ultra-portable tablets and mobile-centric applications meshes with what Jeff Bezos 
(the dynamic CEO of Amazon) has said in recent interviews, that the two technologies will be combined in 
the new Kindle, with the Silk browser that ships with the Fire teaming with the Amazon Cloud to pre-render 
and thus speed up the delivery of web pages to the device.</p>

<p>But the possibilities go even further than that.  INTEL already has an interesting technology that they 
have developed to clone the OS/applications of the end user device in the cloud.  Itâ€™s called CloudClone 
(appropriately enough) and itâ€™s smart enough to decide which processing should be done on the client device 
and which needs to be done in the cloud.  Iâ€™m not just talking pre-processing the browser here, but cloning 
the entire OS and application layers so that users with inexpensive, light, mobile devices, even though 
they pale in comparison to todayâ€™s laptops from a processor and memory standpoint, could have virtually 
unlimited processing power for the most intense applications imaginable.  All that is needed is the 
ever-more-reliable and available network connection.  Can you imagine using 1024 compute instances to 
calculate a really heavy calculation and then releasing all but a few of those instances, using the rest 
to display the results in pre-rendered 3D on the Kindle, while at the same time releasing all of the 
remaining compute instances?  There are some real challenges moving forward but thinking of the many 
variations is exciting.</p>

<p>Am I ditching my IPAD in favor of a Kindle immediately?  Of course not.  But it will be very interesting 
to see what develops with Amazon and their new offering;  interesting enough that I will probably invest 
in a new Kindle in pretty short order.  As I ready this blog post, I see an article that Amazon has 
struck a deal with Disney to stream their content.  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Disney-Pens-Licensing-Deals-wscheats-4258741656.html?x=0">You can see the article here</a>.  To me, the possibilities are endless.</p>
