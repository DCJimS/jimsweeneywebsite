<p>WOW!. It‚Äôs sure been a long time.  (Almost 6 years to be more precise).  A lot has happened in my life and in technology. I‚Äôve been busy with projects for various government agencies, and major pharmecuticals architecting, designing and implementing Virtualization and AWS Cloud solutions.  It‚Äôs been fun. But one thing I have missed is writing about it.  So‚Ä¶ time to catch up.</p>

<p>For a first step, I‚Äôm working on the web site.  The ‚Äúnew book‚Äù is now 6 years old and I was fortunate to write a chapter in the ‚ÄúEncyclopedia of Cloud Computer‚Äù, which was a real honor.  You might remember, back when I was actively posting on a regular basis, that I was proud to be using jekyll for blogging (it really makes it easy) and hosting my website without using a server in AWS S3 storage.  While that was pretty state of the art then, its not 6 years later.  So follow me as I update my site, move to a new serverless architecture and write about all the cool things I‚Äôve been doing in both Cloud Computing and Virtualization</p>

<p>I promise, the next blog post wont be 6 years from now!</p>

<p>Until then, thanks for reading.  Follow me on twitter at @DCJimS</p>
